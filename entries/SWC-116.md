# Title 
Timestamp Dependence

## Relationships
[CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)

## Description 

Contracts often need access to the current timestamp to trigger time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't set timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.

## Remediation

Developers should write smart contracts with the notion that block timestamp and real timestamp may vary up to half a minute. Alternatively, they can use an external source of timestamp via oracles.
