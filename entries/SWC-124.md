# Title 
Lack of input parameter check

## Relationships
[CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

## Description 
When dealing with function parameters, it is necessary to extensively check the input provided by a user. Lack of such checks can lead to unexpected changes in the internal state, loss of funds, or even contract execution freeze.

## Remediation
Use `require()` to validate input. Extra care should be given to anything related to user balances and fund transfers.
