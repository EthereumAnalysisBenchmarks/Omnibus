# Title
Typographical Error

## Relationships

## Description
This typographical error could happen when the intent of a defined operation into smart contract is to sum a number to a variable (+=), for instance, but it accidentally has been defined in a wrong way (=+), introducing a typo which happened to be a valid operator. Instead of sum it to the variable it initializes again the variable with a positive number or with another variable. In any case the unary + operator is deprecated in new solidity compiler versions.

## Remediation
The vulnerability would have been avoided by performing pre-condition checks on any math operation or implementing safe math library, as the one provided using SafeMath developed by OpenZeppelin. This contract provides functions to perform mathematical operations with safety checks.
