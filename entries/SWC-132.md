# Title
Unexpected Ether Balance

## Relationships
[CWE-667: Improper Locking](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/667.html)

## Description
Contracts can behave erroneously when they strictly assume a specific Ether balance. It is always possible to forcibly send ether to a contract (without triggering its fallback function), using selfdestruct, or by mining to the account. In the worst case scenario this could lead to DOS conditions that might render the contract unusable. 

## Remediation
Avoid strict equality checks for the Ether balance in a contract.
