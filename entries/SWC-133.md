## Description 

A code smell is the catch-all SWC for unsafe coding practices. A code smell is not a vulnerability itself, but it signifies that a vulnerability is more likely to occur in the smart contract. In some cases, the code smell is a direct precursor to a vulnerability, but in other situations, code smells are simply a sign of poorly-maintained code. As code smells can easily overlap with other SWCs, this SWC-133 in particular is a fallback for code smells not covered by other SWCs.

Some examples of code smells include:
 - Unused code
 - Significant duplication of code
 - A `pure` function that reads the contract state
 - Tautologies in comparisons

## Remediation

Specific remediation steps will be different depending on the code smell.
