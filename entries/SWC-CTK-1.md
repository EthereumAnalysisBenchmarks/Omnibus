## Description 
CertiK chain stores auditing certificates as an evidence of historical auditing on chain. The certificate indicates that a deployed smart contract has been validated to be the same as the version that was audited and proved to be safe, thus has a strong quality assurance.

## Remediation
A project would have to request auditing from [CertiK](https://certik.io) in order to receive a certificate.
